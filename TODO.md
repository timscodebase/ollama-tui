# TODOS

To improve the Ollama TUI application, we can consider several aspects such as user interface enhancements, error handling improvements, performance optimizations, and additional features. Here's a list of potential improvements:

## 1 User Interface Enhancements

- Responsive Design: Ensure that the UI elements adapt well to different screen sizes and orientations.
- Theming Support: Add support for theming (dark mode, light mode) by modifying the CSS or adding configuration options.
- Better Typography: Use more readable fonts and adjust text size for better user experience.

## 2 Error Handling Improvements

- Detailed Error Messages: Provide more context in error messages to help users understand what went wrong.
- Retry Mechanism: Implement a retry mechanism for transient errors like network issues, before displaying an error screen.

## 3 Performance Optimizations

- Streamlining API Calls: Ensure that the app makes efficient use of Ollama's APIs and minimizes resource usage.
- Background Loading: Use asynchronous processing for operations such as fetching model details or loading files to keep UI responsive.

## 4 Additional Features

- Model Information: Add a screen to display detailed information about selected models, including metadata like authors, licenses, etc.
- Batch Processing: Allow users to submit multiple messages at once and show responses in batch.
- Save/Load Sessions: Enable saving the chat history to disk so users can resume their conversations later.

## 5 Navigation Improvements

- Keyboard Shortcuts: Enhance navigation by implementing more keyboard shortcuts for actions like switching tabs or refreshing content.
- Search Functionality: Implement a search feature for quickly finding specific models within the list.

## 6 Customization Options

- User Preferences: Allow users to set preferences such as default model, font size, theme, etc., and save these settings locally (in a config file or environment variables).

## 7 Testing Enhancements

- Unit Tests: Write unit tests for critical components like the model fetching logic, chat processing, and error handling.
- Integration Tests: Test end-to-end functionality to ensure that switching between screens works correctly.

## 8 Security Improvements

- Secure API Requests: Ensure that any data transmitted is done so securely (e.g., using HTTPS).
- User Authentication: If the app grows in complexity, consider adding user authentication for personalizing their experience.

## 9 Documentation and Usage Guidelines

- Code Comments: Add inline comments to complex sections of code to explain why certain decisions were made.
- README.md: Write a comprehensive README file that guides users on how to install the app, run it, and use its features effectively.

## 10 Deployment Improvements

- Docker Support: Create Dockerfile(s) for easy deployment using Docker or containerization technologies.
- Static Analysis Tools: Integrate tools like SonarQube to analyze code quality and performance before release.


By addressing these points, you can enhance the usability, reliability, and maintainability of the Ollama TUI application. Remember that implementation will depend on how much effort you're willing to invest in each area and which enhancements are most critical for your target user base.
